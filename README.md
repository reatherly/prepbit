# prepbit

Warning! This project is very large. It could exceed several gigabytes!

## prepbit- Is a bare foundation and framework that can be built upon. It includes everything needed to start from the ground up in the event of an society collapse scenario. More info to come. By no means is it complete. Contributors are welcome. Please report errors and issues in a polite manner. I am the only one working on this project at this time. I also work three full time jobs and have three kids. Thank you.

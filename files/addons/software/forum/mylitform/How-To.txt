my little forum

my little forum is a simple PHP and MySQL based internet forum that displays the messages in classical threaded view (tree structure). It is Open Source licensed under the GNU General Public License. The main claim of this web forum is simplicity. Furthermore it should be easy to install and run on a standard server configuration with PHP and MySQL.

System requirements

Webserver with PHP >= 5.4 and MySQL >= 5.5.3

Installation

Unzip the script package.
Upload the complete folder "forum" to your server.
Depending on your server configuration the write permissions of the subdirectory templates_c (CHMOD 770, 775 or 777) and the file config/db_settings.php (CHMOD 666) might need to be changed in order that they are writable by the script.
Run the installation script by accessing yourdomain.tld/forum/install/ in your web browser and follow the instructions.

You must know PHP to add a link in navigation back to your page.
